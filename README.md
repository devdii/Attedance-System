## Project Description
The **Smart Attendance System** is an automated solution designed to track attendance using facial recognition technology. It simplifies the process of attendance management by eliminating manual errors and providing real-time data capture for both administrators and users.

## Key Features
- **Facial Recognition**: Leverages AI for real-time facial recognition and attendance marking.
- **Automated Process**: Seamlessly records attendance without manual intervention.
- **Admin Interface**: Provides a management dashboard to monitor and review attendance logs.
- **Accurate Data**: Ensures precise data capturing and reduces errors.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for use in schools, workplaces, and events of all sizes.

## Installation
